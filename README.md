The link to my webpage is here:
https://students-database.onrender.com/home.html

1. The Webpage link brings the user to the main home page, where they are presented with a navigation bar at the top allowing users to select what they want to do to the student database.
2. The options are to add a student, delete a student, update a student's attributes (ie Name, weight, height, hair colour and gpa) and view the students displayed as rectangles.
3. If the user chooses to add a student by selecting a choice on the navigation bar, They are presented with a form that requires the user to fill in all the attributes I mentioned above to create a new student which will be stored in a database.
If the result was successful, users are presented with a success page and a link to return to the home directory.
4. If the user selects the delete button, they are required to enter all the student's information. If there exists such student in the database with the correct attributes, they will get removed and will no longer be displayed in the display page. The user will again be linked to a success page from which they can return home.
If the student with the attributes entered doesn't exist, the webpage clears the form and allows users to reenter the correct attributes.
5. If user selects the change student attributes button, they will be presented with a search form, where similarly to the delete function also refreshes and clears the form if the student with the provided attributes was not found, or redirects you to another form that displays the current attributes of that student.
The user can choose which values they would like to update ir leave certain features as they were before. The page will then redirect you to the display page if the update was successful. If not, it returns to the home page.
6. Lastly, if the user selects the display students button, they are displayed a variety of rectangles, each corresponding to a student (the length and width are equal to the height and weight of those students). The border colour is based on that student's hair colour (ex brown border for brown hair). Each student rectangle also contains links to return to the delete or the update forms.
7. This page also contains a link to click, in order to navigate back to home.
